\section{Discretization}%
\label{sec:discretization}
Recall that our end goal is not to optimize the continuous representation of the toroidal grid, $S$, but rather the discrete grid $X$. To be able to convert $S$ into $X$, we must take into account the tokens in the positions with the highest confidence. And once this token is established within $X$, all of the entries within $S$ within the same token value (ie. same row), or same position (ie. same column) should be removed. This should be repeated until all the entries within $X$ are filled.

Let $r$ and $c$ (representing rows and columns) be empty sets. The procedure is then as following.
\begin{align*}
    r,c\leftarrow r,c\cup \argmax_{m\notin r,n\notin c}S_{m,n}\\
    X_{i,j}=O_{k,l}
\end{align*}
while $\argmax$ is defined. The conversion from $m$ and $n$ to $i,j$ and $k,l$ is stated within \ref{ssub:token_comparisons}.
