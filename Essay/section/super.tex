\label{sec:superposition}
Since the entries into the toroidal grid are discrete (eg. $AA$ can only be in one position), it is not possible to optimize the loss function. Therefore, relaxing the constraints to enable superposition -- here defined as having a token being in multiple positions at once each with its own ``probabilities'' -- is essential.

A simple method of allowing superposition, is by allowing any position to have any token value
